# pythonSMS

### A CSH Texting Service

## Background
pythonSMS is a command line program that allows Computer Science House memebers to send text messages to one another. There are two ways in which messages can be sent. The first is by sending the message by entering the member's username and the other method is by entering the number manually. The member who logins into the program determines the signature signing the message.
